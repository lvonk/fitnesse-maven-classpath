1. Introduction.

    FitNesse plugin that provides Maven Classpath support.

2. How to use.

    For the current head (does *NOT* work on fitnesse v20110104!):
    - Get the latest from fitnesse from git (https://github.com/unclebob/fitnesse) and compile with: ant jar
    - Add the following line to plugins.properties: SymbolTypes = fitnesse.wikitext.widgets.MavenClasspathSymbolType.
    - Copy the maven-classpath-plugin-[version]-jar-with-dependencies.jar to the plugins directory of the directory where the fitnesse.jar is located.
    - Start FitNesse: java -jar fitnesse.jar
    - Refer to the pom file as follows: !pomFile /path/to/pom.xml.
    - The plugin will use the test classpath from the pom as classpath in FitNesse.

    For v20101101 and earlier:
    - Download the 1.2 distribution.
    - Add the following line to plugins.properties: WikiWidgets = fitnesse.wikitext.widgets.MavenClasspathWidget.
    - Copy the maven-classpath-plugin-[version]-jar-with-dependencies.jar to the plugins directory of the directory where the fitnesse.jar is located.
    - Start FitNesse: java -jar fitnesse.jar
    - Refer to the pom file as follows: !pomFile /path/to/pom.xml.
    - The plugin will use the test classpath from the pom as classpath in FitNesse.
